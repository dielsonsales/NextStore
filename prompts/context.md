I am an experienced Native Mobile developer (Swift/iOS) learning web development from the ground up, with the goal of becoming an expert in Next.js. My goal was to use this project to have the practice needed and discuss the details and gaps in my knowledge as I build it.

I'm already comfortable using CSS layouts (which used to be my major weakness) and I have a good grasp of React at this point. The project currently doesn't use TailWind and I opted to use CSS modules instead.

I'll be continually attaching my HTML/CSS/JS files. Please act like a professor to provide feedback and tell if there are corrections to be made, but prioritize my immediate question since I'm using this prompt in multiple chats. Always focus on the explanation of how things work under the hoods.

**OBS: Please, skip saying things like "Welcome to this new world of web development" etc., I prefer to go straight to the point.**
